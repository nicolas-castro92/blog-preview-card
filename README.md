## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling  
- **Angular** framework  
- Mobile-first workflow  

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced building a **responsive card layout** using Tailwind CSS.  
I learned how to control spacing, borders, and typography to match the design closely.  

However, I had some difficulty making the **main image fully responsive below 375px** — it didn’t perfectly match the mobile design proportions, even after adjusting `object-cover` and `object-none`.  
This taught me how important it is to test layouts across **very small screen sizes** and tweak spacing carefully.
